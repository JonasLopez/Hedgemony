# Maze Problem

## Personnel
Jonas Lopez, Samuel Ramos

## Statement of Problem
What is the Boolean value of the statement "it is possible to get from the starting position to treasure"?

## Recursive Abstraction
When I am asked to <br />
find a path such that the explorer reaches treasure in n moves, <br />
the recursive abstraction can <br />
find a path such that the explorer reaches treasure in n-1 moves, starting on a stepping stone adjacent to the stepping stone it was on before

## Base Case
0. The explorer is on the treasureâ€“no moves need to be made. Returns true.
1. The explorer is in a wall. Returns false.

## English or pseudocode description of algorithm
0. Check for the two base cases: if the explorer is on the treasure or in a wall. <br />
    if true: executes base case. <br />
    if false: continue algorithm.
1. Save the current position of the explorer showing its position in the maze.  
2. Invoke the recursive abstraction, starting with the stepping stone to the east of the explorer and going counter-clockwise, check if it is a legal stepping stone to move to. If the stepping stone is legal to move to, then move to it, and repeat from step 1 by saving the current position of the explorer showing its position in the maze.
(Legal elements for movement are not part of the path the explorer has already moved through and also not part of a wall.) 
3. If there is a dead end reached, then recursively backtrack by going back to the previous saved position of the explorer.

## Version *n* Wishlist
* all ways
* shortest way
* focusing on decisions that the explorer makes at junctions/intersections instead of stepping stones

## Known bugs
* Displayer is faulty.
  * Although the explorer recognizes that there are walls in certain spots it had gone on before, the Displayer switches walls back to stepping stones when they should remain walls.
  * Explorer sometimes disappears during operation
