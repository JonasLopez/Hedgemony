# Maze Problem

## Personnel
Jonas Lopez, Samuel Ramos

## Statement of Problem
What is the Boolean value of the statement "it is possible to get from the starting position to treasure"?

## Recursive Abstraction
When I am asked to <br />
find a path such that the explorer reaches treasure in n moves, <br />
the recursive abstraction can <br />
find a path such that the explorer reaches treasure in n-1 moves, starting on a stepping stone adjacent to the stepping stone it was on before

## Base Case
1. The explorer is on the treasureâ€“no moves need to be made. Returns true.
2. The explorer is in a wall. Returns false.

## English or pseudocode description of algorithm
1. Check for the two base cases: if the explorer is on the treasure or in a wall. <br />
    if true: executes base case. <br />
    if false: continue algorithm.
2. Save the current position of the explorer to a 2d array showing its position in the maze.  
3. Invoke the recursive abstraction, starting with the stepping stone of the explorer, check if it is a legal stepping stone to move to. 
(Legal elements for movement are not part of the path the explorer has already moved through and also not part of a wall.)  
4. Check the adjacent stepping stones. If the stepping stone is legal to move to, then move to it, and repeat from step 2.
5. If there is a dead end reached, then go back to the stepping stone where the decision was made.
